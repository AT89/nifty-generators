Description:
    Generates a user model, users controller, and sessions controller. The 
    users controller handles the registration and the sessions controller 
    handles authentication. This is similar to restful_authentication, but 
    simpler.
    
    IMPORTANT: This generator uses the "title" helper method which is generated
    by the nifty_layout generator. You may want to run that generator first.

Usage:
    If you do not pass any arguments, the model name will default to "user", and
    the authentication controller will default to "sessions". You can override
    each of these respectively by passing one or two arguments. Either name can
    be CamelCased or under_scored.

Examples:
    script/generate nifty_authentication
        
        Creates user model, users_controller, and sessions_controller.
    
    script/generate nifty_authentication account
    
        Creates account model, accounts_controller, and sessions_controller.
    
    script/generate nifty_authentication Account CurrentSession
    
        Creates account model, accounts_controller, and current_sessions_controller.
