Description:
  The nifty_layout generator creates a basic stylesheet and layout
	which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

  The generator takes one argument which will be the name of the
	layout and stylesheet files.

Usage:
  ./script/generate nifty_layout application

    This will create two files:
        Layout:     app/views/layouts/application.html.erb
        Stylesheet: public/stylesheets/application.css
