= nifty-generator

A collection of useful Rails generator scripts by Ryan Bates.


== Install

  gem install ryanb-nifty-generators --source=http://gems.github.com

  
== Usage

Once you install the gem, the generators will be available to all Rails
applications on your system. If you run script/generate without any
additional arguments you should see the available generators listed.

To run the generator, go to your rails project directory and call it
using the script/generate or script/destroy command.

  script/generate nifty_scaffold Recipe name:string index new

  
== Included Generators

* nifty_layout: generates generic layout, stylesheet, and helper files.
* nifty_scaffold: generates a controller and optional model/migration.

Run the command with the --help option to learn more.

  script/generate nifty_layout --help

== Troubleshooting

*I get "undefined method 'title'" error for nifty_scaffold.*

Try running nifty_layout too, that will generate this helper method. Or
you can just change the templates to whatever approach you prefer for
setting the title.


*Forms don't work for nifty_scaffold.*

Try restarting your development server. Sometimes it doesn't detect the
change in the routing.

If you wish the generators behaved differently, please consider
forking the project and modifying to your heart's content.
